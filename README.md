Make sure to install Nodejs and check version. My version: v22.15.0

    npm install express csv-parser

Then run:
    node server.js

Deployed with Firebase Hosting via: tracuudiemthithpt.web.app

But there is a problem. Firebase functions used to be free but now it costs money. To sum up, all the logical backend are being block from a costly advanced plan from Firebase. I have tried to deploy it with Heroku but it was time-consuming and there is no time left for me so I quit the "go live" part. All I can show you now is this local code.
